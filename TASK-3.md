Create an AI with chat interface using “CopilotKit”

Create a simple todo app where it can:
List todos
Add todo
Remove todo
Edit todo

Have an AI copilot chat in a sidebar where the user can type in “Help me create a todo list of what to do in Paris”. The AI will help plan the trip and create/modify the todos.

The AI should be aware of the realtime weather for the trip and advise accordingly.

The user can chat with the AI to add/remove/modify the todos as they please.

The AI should have memory to store proof plans and user preferences. The app should also allow users to come back to the app anytime to update the checklist.
